# FastAPI eCommerce API

## About
This project is an E-Commerce API built using FastAPI, designed to serve both businesses and end-users.
It utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database and employs SQLAlchemy and asyncpg for asynchronous database operations.
It uses Pydantic for request validation and schema management. Alembic is used for managing database schema migrations, ensuring a smooth upgrade and rollback of database changes.

This project serves as a strong foundation for developers to build upon.

## Setup
1. Install `git`, `podman`, `postgresql`, `poetry` and `virtualenv` on your development environment.  
   Command
   ```shell
   $ sudo dnf install git podman postgresql poetry virtualenv
   ```
2. Ensure that `podman` service is enabled and started.  
   Command
   ```shell
   $ sudo systemctl enable podman.service
   ```
   Sample output
   ```shell
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/podman.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/podman.service.
   ```
   Command
   ```shell
   $ sudo systemctl start podman.service
   ```
3. Clone the repository to the local storage.  
   Command
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/sdglitched/FastAPI-eCom.git
   ```
   Sample output
   ```shell
   Cloning into 'FastAPI-eCom'...

   ```
   Command
   ```shell
   $ cd FastAPI-eCom
   ```
4. Download the official `postgres` image from `docker.io/library/quay.io` OCI images repository and start a container with your preferred settings.  
   Command
   ```shell
   $ podman pull docker.io/library/postgres:latest
   ```

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdglitched/FastAPI-eCom/main/docs/imgs/order_enpt.png)  

## Future Roadmap
1. Implement _OIDC/OAuth2_ for authentication instead for HTTP Basic Auth.  
2. Implement _admin_ functionality across all the routes.  
3. Implement _archiving_ across all the routes instead of direct deletion from database.  
4. Implement _carting_ functionality while placing order.  
5. Implement some kind of verification for customers and businesses.
